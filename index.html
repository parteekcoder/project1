        <summary>When did 🍟🍟🍟 first appear in the History?</summary>
        Belgian food historian Pierre Leclercq has traced the history of the
        french fry and asserts that "it is clear that fries are of French
        origin". Fries are first mentioned in 1775 in a Parisian book, and the
        first recipe for modern French fries is in the French cookbook
